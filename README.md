# ticketmaster Tech testThis test should take you approximately two hours, if it takes longer, no problem, don’t spend days on it!One of our developers wrote this code a while ago, but as we’re sure you know,sometimes code that was written in the past needs a little refactoring!That’s exactly what we’d like you to do in this test:1. Take some time to get comfortable with the code2. Find areas that you would improve (keep a note of them, we’d like to see all of the things that you think need improving, even if you don’t find the time to work through all of them)3. If you think you can improve this code, go for it! We would like to see how you structure your code too, so change it as you see fit to make it look like your perfect project.Send us the list of areas you’d like to improve along with your refactored code.**NOTE**: As you could appreciate, it builds a gallery of images from flickr, so the first thing you need to do is getting a flickr API KEY and place it on the config.We wish you the best of the lucks! :)
